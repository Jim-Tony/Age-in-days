# Age-in-days
This is simple Webpage which is used to calculate our age in days.
--> I have used the basic HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
--> The static folder contains the stylesheet ans js file.
--> I have used flexbox option in the stylesheet to make more easier.
--> Another stylesheet I have linked is from Bootstrap exclusively for the button tags.
--> You can also get it as follows
       --> Search Quick Bootstrap cdn 4 on google -> Enter the website -> Copy the complete CSS link -> Paste in the required href of your style tag.
--> That's all for this, and I have used only basic CSS options.
