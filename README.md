# Age-in-days
This is simple Webpage which is used to calculate our age in days.
I have used the basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The static folder contains the stylesheet ans js file.
I have used flexbox option in the stylesheet to make more easier.
Another stylesheet I have linked is from Bootstrap exclusively for the button tags.
Click the below link for the stylesheet <br>
[<p> Click me </p>]:[bootstrap]

Search Quick Bootstrap cdn 4 on google <br> -> Enter the website -> Copy the complete CSS link -> Paste in the required href of your style tag.
That's all for this, and I have used only basic CSS options.

[bootstrap] : https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css
